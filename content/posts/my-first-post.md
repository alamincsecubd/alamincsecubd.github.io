# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using **Jekyll**. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you!

## About Me

I'm a passionate writer who loves to explore various topics. In this blog, I'll be discussing:

- Personal development
- Technology
- Travel
- Cooking

## What to Expect

I plan to post regularly, sharing insights, tips, and stories. Feel free to leave comments and engage with the content.

Here's a simple code snippet to brighten your day:

​```python
print("Hello, world!")
​```

Another python code(how to check if a number is prime or not):
```python
def is_prime(number: int) -> bool:
    # Time complexity: O(sqrt(n))
    if number == 1:
        return False
    i = 2
    while i*i <= number:
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        i += 1
    return True
```

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
